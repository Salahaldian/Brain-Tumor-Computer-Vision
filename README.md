# 🧠 Brain-Tumor-Computer-Vision

A browser-based deep learning application that performs **brain tumor classification and segmentation** on MRI scans.  

## 🚀 Overview

This web app allows users to upload brain MRI images and receive:

- A classification of **tumor presence** (Tumor / No Tumor)
- A **segmentation map** highlighting tumor boundaries
- A visual overlay of tumor contours on the original scan

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- 🧠 TensorFlow & Keras – For building and loading pre-trained models  
- 🖼 OpenCV – For image processing and contour drawing  
- 🎈 Streamlit – For building the interactive web interface  
- 📊 NumPy, PIL – For image handling and array manipulation

## 🔍 Features

- ✅ Tumor Classification using ResNet architecture (Tumor vs No Tumor)
- ✅ Tumor Segmentation using U-Net architecture
- ✅ Boundary overlay for visual reference

- ✅ **`The core functionality is up and running, but there’s still room to improve the accuracy and fine-tune the models for better generalization across different MRI cases.`**
